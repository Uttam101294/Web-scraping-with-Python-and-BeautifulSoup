## Introduction to Web Scraping
##### Web scraping is a technique used to extract large amounts of data from websites. Web scraping is also known as web harvesting, web data extraction or screen scraping. The data is extracted from the websites and saved to a local file in the computer. This is most commonly done by writing an automated program. The program queries a web server, requests data (in the form of html and other files) and then parses that data to extract the required information. Web scraping encompasses a wide variety of programming techniques and technologies. The examples include data analysis, natural language parsing and information security.
